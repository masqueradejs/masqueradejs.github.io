situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person
and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are
involved.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>Our servers are located in. If you are accessing our from outside,
please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and
processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom
we may share your personal information (see “<a href="#infoshare">WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE
SHARED WITH ANYONE?</a>” above), in and other countries.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these
countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar
laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all
necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance
with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p><strong>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>

<p>\</p>

longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your

measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
information to and from our is at your own risk. You should only access

<p>\</p>

<p><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>

<p>\</p>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

data, please contact us using the contact information provided below,

statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is
not publicly displayed on the , but please be aware that the data may
not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g.
backups, etc.).</p>

<p>\</p>

<p><strong>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</strong></p>
